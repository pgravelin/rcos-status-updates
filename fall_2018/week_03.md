## Last Week's Accomplishments

Successfully completed prerequisite installation and created a Docker Image.
We also now have a better direction of where the project will be going and have
found a crowdsourcing platform for data retrieval called SimFin. Learned
the essential github commands on bash.

## This Week's Plan

Learn the basics of NodeJS and Express to begin building the site's RESTful
API.

## Anything Blocking?

No prior experience building APIs.
