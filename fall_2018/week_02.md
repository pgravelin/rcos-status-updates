## Last Week's Accomplishments

I've decided to work on the website's API and have a better idea of how the
work will be distributed. Based on the meeting, group members will be assigned
sub projects to do over the course of the semester.

## This Week's Plan

Get my work environment set up and the prerequisites installed.

## Anything Blocking?

Prerequisites haven't been finalized, since the previous semester's installation
instructions are outdated.
