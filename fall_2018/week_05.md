## Last Week's Accomplishments

Constructed a wireframe backend, consisting of four apps to represent 
an about page, an analytics module, a tools suite, and a userAuthentication 
app, which will contain routes to user registration, profile, etc. 
Source code can be found on the RestAPI-wireframe branch.

## This Week's Plan

Connect to the postgres database and resolve templating issue.

## Anything Blocking?

Experiencing a possible bug with Django itself (?) with regards to
searching inside application template directories. Django does not
seem to want to look inside any other directories than the base
directory for templates.
