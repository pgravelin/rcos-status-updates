# Last Week's Accomplishments

Earlier this week, I worked with Kris Kwan to put the finishing touches on our
user authentication system. Together, we created an registration appreciation email.
Individually, I segregated sign-in into a Github credentials sign-in and a 
website-specific one. I then refactored the sign-in view to include the sending
of the email.   

## This Week's Plan

Deploy website to heroku and present at large group.

## Anything Blocking?

Nothing blocking.
