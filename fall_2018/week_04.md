## Last Week's Accomplishments

Didn't convene last week, so I looked at RESTful API documentation to
get a better foundation on what we will be doing.

## This Week's Plan

Present on RESTful API to small group meeting and practice building RESTful.

## Anything Blocking?

Still need to understand how we will be integrating our work into the 
website.
