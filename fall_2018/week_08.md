## Last Week's Accomplishments

Last week, I implemeneted a simple authentication system for our 
website that allows a user to log into our website using their
Github credentials.

## This Week's Plan

This week, I plan to merge those changes into the main branch and
consult with the team on speaking roles for our presentation on Friday.
I also plan to practice presenting.

## Anything Blocking?

Nothing blocking.
